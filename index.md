            <h3>Socratic</h3>
            <span class="app-status beta">Beta</span>
            <p>Most teachers give you answers. Socrates did the opposite. He only asked questions. And somehow that worked better.</p>
            <p>Not a chat. Not a journal. An app that asks you questions like Socrates would. It doesn't give opinions. It finds contradictions in your thinking. It waits for you to sit with the question. And at the end, you write the conclusion. Not the AI.</p>
            <ul class="app-features">
                <li>AI-powered Socratic questioning method</li>
                <li>Finds contradictions in your thinking</li>
                <li>No opinions, only questions</li>
                <li>You write the final conclusion</li>
